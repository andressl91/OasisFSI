Basic postprocessing fields.

These fields can all be created from the postprocessor from name only.
This is useful when handling dependencies for a postprocessing field: ::

    class DummyField(Field):
        def __init__(self, field_dep):
            self.field_dep = field_dep

        def compute(self, get):
            val = get(field_dep)
            return val/2.0

If a postprocessing field depends only on basic fields to be calculated, the
dependencies will be implicitly added to the postprocessor "on the fly" from
the name alone: ::

    field = DummyField("ABasicField")
    pp = NSPostProcessor()
    pp.add_field(field) # Implicitly adds ABasicField object

For non-basic dependencies, the dependencies have to be explicitly added *before*
the field depending on it: ::

    dependency = ANonBasicField("ABasicField")
    field = DummyField(dependency.name)
    pp.add_field(dependency) # Added before field
    pp.add_field(field) # pp now knows about dependency

# Fields that can be constructed just by name
basic_fields = [
    # The basic solution fields:
    "Velocity",
    "Pressure",

    # The basic problem parameters:
